### What did you do this past week?

Presented the group project and took the exam. The project presentation went
pretty smoothly. There weren't that many people in class when we presented
(actually, the only people who showed up were the people presenting + Professor
Downing), but I guess that made presenting easier. Our group got a point off
for not putting the actual time spent on each of our user stories in the wiki,
but other than that, I'm happy with our grade. 

The exam went pretty well, I think. Unlike the first exam, I spent a good amount
of time studying for this one. Although I stayed the full hour and a half
checking and re-checking my answers even though I was finished in the first
45 minutes, but I feel pretty confident about my grade.


### What's in your way?

Nothing, for this class.
Exam 2 grades haven't come out, but besides that, this class is officially over!
I had three tests the same day as the SWE one - awful, but that now means that
I only have 1 final next Saturday, and I have *all* week to study for it.

### What will you do next week?

_**Relax**_ and enjoy some time off before starting to study for my only final
(it's just BIO 311C, but I still don't want to slack off). 

### Tip of the Week

[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) is a really cool JavaScript framework that
is *very* user-friendly and is very easy to use. I'm thinking of using it in my
next project.

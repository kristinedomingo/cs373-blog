### What did you do this past week?

Group project presentations began this week. I was actually really looking
forward to seeing these, as I wanted to see how other groups used the tools
that we were given (required to use). I've enjoyed seeing the presentations
so far, although on Friday I was really tempted to not come to class.Since we're
not doing
quizzes anymore, there's really no incentive to come (well, the incentive is
seeing the presentations, but there's no punishment if you don't come). I'm
just going to stick it out though - I have class at 11am right after SWE, so
I might as well. 


### What's in your way?

Studying for exam 2. After calculating my grade + dropped quizzes + extra credit,
I realized that I have a pretty safe minimum grade to make on the exam to make
an A in the class. I still want to study hard and study early though - the XML
stuff especially.

### What will you do next week?

Listen to other presentations, give our group's presentation, and study for the
exam. There's really only two more class days left for this class, and as much
as I've enjoyed it, I'm looking forward to being done.

### Tip of the Week

[Charted.co](http://www.charted.co/) is a really cool website that allows you to
import a .csv file or Google Spreadsheet and get a pretty-looking visualization
of the data. It even provides code to embed the chart on a website.

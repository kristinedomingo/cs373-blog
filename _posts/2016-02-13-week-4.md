### What did you do this past week?
My project partner and I (unexpectedly) finished Project #2,
[Netflix](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Netflix.html)
on Friday. "Finished" as in our solution achieved an RMSE of less than 1,
with [probe.txt](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/netflix/probe.txt)
as the input - we still haven't written unit tests, created the Pydoc
documentation, etc. But hopefully that shouldn't take more than an hour to
do.

Finishing the project was unexpected because I honestly thought there would
be a lot of work involved trying to come up with an algorithm to predict
customer ratings, when in reality, the solution was very simple to figure
out, mainly because it was *given* to us in one of the articles listed on the 
[project page](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Netflix.html).
The article mentions that if all our `netflix_eval()` did was to predict a
rating of 3.7 for *every* customer rating, that by itself (no logic involved)
returned an RMSE of 1.05. Then, with just a little bit of work involving a
movie offset and a customer offset (which the article explains), the RMSE
is improved to 0.97, which satisfies Professor Downing's project requirement.

Once we write tests and finish all of the extra requirements for
[Netflix](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Netflix.html),
I think my project partner and I will have spent maybe 6 hours on this
project? Way less than the typical 20 hours or so I typically expect for
a Downing project. Of course, I've heard from others who have taken the class
previously that satisfying the extra credit requirement (RMSE < 0.95) takes
a *lot* of work and hours put into the project. If there's time this coming
week, my project partner and I talked about maybe trying for the extra
credit, but at this point, I think we're both satisfied with getting
this out of the way so early.

### What's in your way?

Nothing *immediate* at the moment, but I feel like I really need to start
catching up and learning about the tools and frameworks listed on the
[course homepage](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/index.html)
in preparation for the next three projects. I'm familiar with some
([Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), 
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)) but have never used others
([SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/))
and have no idea what one even is, even after visiting
the tool's homepage ([Apiary](https://apiary.io/)?).

### What will you do next week?

I'll use some of the free time I have to start learning about the
tools I mentioned above. I'm also going to catch up on the
readings for *Javascript: The Good Parts*, not just in preparation
for possible upcoming reading-related quizzes, but also for
the next three projects.

### Tip of the Week

Learn about the language you're using to code. Don't try to write code
in one language like how you would write code in another, just with
the syntax changed. When I was driving (on the keyboard) for this
project, there were multiple times where I would be writing Python
like how I would write C++. Each of those times, my project partner
would stop me and mention that "we could probably do this in one
line", or show me a cool little Python trick that reduced lines of
code significantly. As a result, all of the methods we have in
`Netflix.py` look super neat and clean. Python's pretty cool.

### What did you do this past week?

Our group finished up [phase 2](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/IDB2.html)
of IDB. Things went very smoothly - thanks to the great work of the back-end people on our team,
and the work that was done on the front-end side of things last phase, connecting the
two was a pretty seamless process. I'm glad that because of the work
Micah and I did during phase 1, all we had to do
to pull from our database was to replace the API calls from
[Spotify's](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to our own. There was still a good amount
of work to do on the front-end (sorting and pagination were a little more complicated than
I thought), but we finished pretty early and just met Thursday to tie up loose ends and
finish up the technical report.


### What's in your way?

Nothing but [phase 3](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/IDB3.html) of the
project next week. The SQL we have been learning in class is pretty simple, and something I've
already learned in CS 347, Data Management. I'm not complaining though, since that means
the quizzes have been pretty simple as well.

### What will you do next week?

Work on phase 3 of IDB. The search bar doesn't seem *too* hard to implement, but I do
wanna start earlier rather than later. I also kind of want to revamp
[our website's](http://sweetmusic.me/) design, but that's definitely a low priority.

### Tip of the Week

When working with more complicated projects like IDB, it's important to plan the
details early. Since this is a school project with time limitations, a lot of that early planning
and refining was sort of rushed through. This led to a kind of gacky implementation
of sorting by album length on our [Albums Table page](http://sweetmusic.me/#/albums)
(something that I take complete responsibility for!).

When scraping the data, Spotify's Album API endpoint did not provide a property that specified
album length (duration). So, the scraper I wrote summed up all of the album's tracks' durations
(which were integers representing milliseconds), *parsed that result into a human-readable string*, and added that
to the Album data. For example, `(int) 294872` (ms) would be converted to `(string) "4:55"` (mm:ss). The emphasized
text is where things went wrong - since the only data about an album's length is in the form of
a string, how do you sort albums by length? I ended up converting that string **_back_** into an integer
representing seconds (I know) and using that to sort. Lessons learned, I guess.

(The *correct* way to fix this would've
been to change `scraper.py`, re-scrape the data, and re-populate the database... but we have
a lot of data, and that would've taken probably a good 30 minutes.)

### What did you do this past week?
Our group spent some time working on the [second phase](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/IDB2.html)
of the IDB project. At this point, most of the back-end related work is done - 
data scraping, models, populating the database, the API. The next steps are
mostly on the front-end side, to switch our API calls from
[Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to our own. 


### What's in your way?

I have a test on Friday, but other than that, not much else. Since the work that
is left on the project is mainly on the front-end, which I'm much more
experienced in/would rather work on, my schedule is pretty free to work on
finishing this phase. 

### What will you do next week?

Since phase two is due Thursday night, I'm guessing next week will involve
working on phase three (whatever that is). I know we're supposed to use someone
else's API, and something about a search bar? It seems like after this phase
is complete, there won't be that much else to do, but I guess I"ll see.

### Tip of the Week
I got this from [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/). It's
a common practice to mark unreachable code paths. Professor Downing does this
in his code examples by saying `assert(false)`. Doing a search on GitHub for
"This should never happen" brings up some [amusing results](https://github.com/search?q=This+should+never+happen&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

## What did you do this past week?
For this class, not much, since I had finished
[Collatz](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Collatz.html)
the previous week, Sphere acceptance and all,
and just had to turn it in. The Friday after turning in a Downing
project always makes me a little anxious, waiting for the email of doom
(notification of incomplete submission), but thanksfully, nothing came.

I also read the assigned textbook readings this time! Unfortunately, Friday's
quiz did not go over the readings; instead, it tested our understanding of
the code we went over on Wednesday.
It had a tricky question followed by another *very* similar question with the
*same* answer choices that,
essentially, let you know whether or not you got the tricky question right.
For example, the tricky question:
{% highlight python %}
a = (2, 3)
t = (5, a, 6)
a += (4,)
print(a, end = " ")
print(t)
{% endhighlight %}

The answer was ` (2, 3, 4) (5, (2, 3), 6)`, and 13% of the class got
it right. The next question was:
{% highlight python %}
a = [2, 3]
t = (5, a, 6)
a += [4]
print(a, end = " ")
print(t)
{% endhighlight %}

The answer was ` [2, 3, 4] (5, [2, 3, 4], 6)`, and 84% of the class
got this question right, because the previous question made the correct
answer here obvious.

What's frustrating is that once you answer
a question, you're not allowed to go back and change previous answers.
From what I remember in OOP last semester, Professor Downing does
this style of quiz questions a lot. It's annoying, but the
frustration really drills an understanding of the concepts into your
head. I guess.

## What's in your way?

[Netflix](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Netflix.html)!
The project spec was just posted today, but to be completely honest
after staring at it for a few minutes I'm still sort of confused as to what
we're supposed to be doing. I'm guessing we'll probably get an explanation in
class.

## What will you do next week?

I'm going to work on [Netflix](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Netflix.html)
with my project partner, and hopefully knock a good
chunk of it out.

I also still need to fix how this blog looks on mobile devices - the spacing
between the post title and my picture is really wide and I have no idea why.

## Tip of the Week

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is nice and all, but Yahoo's
[Pure](http://purecss.io) is a pretty great alternative. I like it for the
following reasons:

1. **Its extremely lightweight** - the entire uncompressed set of modules is a
*tiny* 16.9kB, compared to Bootstrap's ~145kB.
2. **The grid system is more flexible** - while Bootstrap uses a 12 column layout,
Pure can do 24, and can also divide pages into fifths.
3. **Bootstrap is so mainstream** - a ton of websites now have that same
"Bootstrappy" feel to it. Check out 
[Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/) on the Bootstrap examples
page - looks familiar right?

All of that being said, Bootstrap still has a much wider range of scenarios
where it would be more helpful/useful than Pure. Its not lightweight because
it can do a lot more. Pure, on the other hand, is great for minimal pages and
simple tasks - all I needed for my personal website was a mobile-responsive grid
system, and Pure gave me exactly that, all in a 0.8kB module.

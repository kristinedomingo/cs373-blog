## 1. What did you do this past week?
I'll start off answering this question with a quote from last week's blog post:

> I'm also going to *really* make an effort to do all of the assigned
readings, something I fell behind on in OOP and eventually stopped doing
altogether. It was a decision that cost me a handful of quiz points, easy points
that I could've really used by the end of the semester.

I didn't do the textbook readings, so I missed the two reading-related questions
on Friday's quiz, so I got a 2/7. Next week, I guess. What I *did* do was finish
[Collatz](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Collatz.html).

I was really interested in seeing what the speed difference would be
between C++ and Python, and came to the conslusion: **_Python is slooowwwww_**. 
In C++, running the naive solution with 20 or so unit tests took about 100ms
on the lab machines. In Python, running those *same* tests with the naive solution
took almost **_3 minutes_**.
After implementing the cache and other optimizations, the `make test` time
improved considerably, but the initial slowness of Python was definitely a
little annoying to work with.

## 2. What's in your way?

At the moment, nothing. But 5 minutes ago, I was trying to figure out why I was getting
a "wrong answer" on [Sphere](http://www.spoj.com/problems/PROBTNPO/),
despite my Collatz solution being, basically, functionally the
same as the C++ solution I did last semester. The funny thing was, **the two
solutions being functionally the same _was_ the reason I was getting a
"wrong answer" on Sphere**. 

In OOP's C++ Collatz, we had to worry about overflowing
a 32-bit integer, so numbers that would reach a value greater than 2<sup>32</sup>
(4294967296) during the Collatz algorithm were ignored. However, overflowing
integers is not an issue in SWE's Python Collatz - so by copying over the exact
same numbers in the metacache that I had computed last semester (instead of 
re-computing them), I was ignoring numbers that most likely had some
of the highest cycle lengths.

Lessons learned: don't be lazy.

## 3. What will you do next week?

I'm also going to actually (**_actually_**) read the textbook chapter readings
this time. The spacing between the headers on this page look really bad on
mobile, so I'm going to fix that too.

## Tip of the Week

I like using code linters because I'm kind of nitpicky about code style, and
having it follow a certain standard. I tried out [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org),
but it felt a bit *too* obsessive-compulsive even for my nitpickiness (I know you
can customize it to conform to your own standard, but that seemed like
too much work). [Pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) is a great alternative.

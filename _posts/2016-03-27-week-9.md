### What did you do this past week?
I spent a lot of time working on the [first phase](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/IDB1.html)
of IDB. I'm pretty happy with what my group was about to accomplish by the due
date and time. I really enjoy web development and I had a lot of fun working
on this project. Some parts were frustrating to do (deploying our web application
to [Carina](https://getcarina.com/)), but overall, I learned a lot in a very
short amount of time.

Before this project began, I honestly thought that working with such a large
group of people (large, relative to the usual size of CS class group projects)
would be difficult and annoying. By the end of this first phase, I've found that
working with others who can have a much different skillset than mine is
extremely rewarding. For me, at least, it is so much easier to learn by example
(seeing what other people are doing and how they're doing it) than to look up
a bunch of [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) answers trying to figure
out why things aren't working.


### What's in your way?

I have two tests this week, which will probably restrict my contribution to
the [second phase](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/IDB1.html)
of the project a bit. After those, though, I'll be pretty free to work on it.

### What will you do next week?

Study for me other tests, and with the time remaining, work on the project. I'm
much more experienced in the front-end side of web development, and this phase
seems to be pretty heavy on the back-end side (as opposed to the first phase),
but there's still a good amount of work to do in regards to communication
between the two sides. 

### Tip of the Week
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is a very powerful and very helpful CSS extension
language. It makes writing CSS so much easier by adding everything from
variables to control statements to what is a pretty basic language. It's not
complicated to use either - a user would just
write a `.scss` file and the compile it to a `.css` file. You can even add a
`--watch` flag to have the `.css` file update every time the `.scss` file is
changed.
